        "\n",
        "This assignment will help you understand the link prediction task, which is one of the most common machine learning tasks that involve networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Link prediction problem is everywhere. For instance, recommendation problems (e.g., Netflix) are link prediction. When you open up Netflix, it suggests you a whole bunch of shows and movies that you may like. In this setting, all users and contents on Netflix can be considered as a bipartite network and the link prediction task is to predict the link between contents and a given user.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, link prediction is heavily used in all social media and social networking services like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and so on. To make users engaged with the platform, they constantly suggest new users or new topics to follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How can we do that?**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are roughly two ways to approach this problem. First, we can look at every pair of candidate node pairs and the local network structure around them to calculate certain metrics that inform the likelihood of a link between two candidates. For instance, if two people have many common friends, maybe they already know each other. Another way to think about this is considering a list of features (characteristics) that a node has (independent of other nodes) and then use the features of two nodes to compute the likelihood of having a link. For instance, if two people have so many common interests, they may already know each other or they will quickly become friends. In other words, both of these thinking leverages the strong homophily (and the clustered structure produced by it) to predict missing links.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most extreme (?) version of node-feature-based approach may be using graph embedding or graph neural networks. Graph embedding learns a vector for each node based on network structure and these vectors become nodes' features. We can perform link prediction by simply calculating the similarity between these vectors. Graph neural networks move further by incorporating existing node features on top of the network structure.\n",

        "\n",
        "You will create a binary classification model to predict links/edges on top of node embeddings. Note that the link prediction (binary classification) is a *supervised* task whereas the learning node representations (embedding) is an *unsupervised* (or self-supervised) task."
